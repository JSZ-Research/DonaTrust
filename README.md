## 🌟 Our Mission
In remote areas, students with visual and hearing impairments often face a double barrier: geographical isolation and communication silence. **DonaTrust** is a decentralized donation platform designed to rewrite this narrative. 

By leveraging blockchain technology, we ensure every drop of kindness is transparent and traceable. More importantly, we use technology to translate gratitude—converting hand signs and diverse languages into a visual bridge that connects the hearts of donors and beneficiaries.

### Why "CTRL+HACK+DEL 2.0"?
- **CTRL (Control):** Empowering disabled students to take control of their own destinies.
- **HACK (Hack):** Using technology to hack through the lack of transparency in traditional charity.
- **DEL (Delete):** Deleting the barriers of distance, sensory impairment, and information asymmetry.
